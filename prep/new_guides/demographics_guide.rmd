# Create a Demographics Files 

The demographics file is a required input file for EMOD that specifies characteristics of the population in a 
simulation. This includes aspects like the population size, birth rates, non-malaria mortality rates, age structure, 
initial prevalence, and more. Full documentation on the [demographics file](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emod-malaria/en/latest/software-demographics.html) and its [parameters/structure](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emod-malaria/en/latest/parameter-demographics.html) are available in the malaria model documentation.

## Single-node simulations

The [emod-api](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emod-api/en/latest/emod_api.demographics.html) package contains most of the major functionality to create a demographics file. It is supported by `emodpy-malaria` to add parameters that are more specific to the malaria workflow, imported as [`Demographics`](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emodpy-malaria/en/latest/emodpy_malaria.demographics.MalariaDemographics.html/github.com/numalariamodeling/emodpy-malaria/blob/main/emodpy_malaria/demographics/MalariaDemographics.py) in the code chunk below. For single node, non-spatial simulations the [`from_template_node`](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emodpy-malaria/en/latest/emodpy_malaria.demographics.MalariaDemographics.html#emodpy_malaria.demographics.MalariaDemographics.from_template_node) command is most commonly used; however, you may also choose to read in pre-made json files for these types of simulations. We include this command in our demographics builder with it's basic parameters:
    - latitude
    - longitude
    - population size
    - site name
    - forced node ID (if desired)
    - initial prevalence value (if desired)
    
With this saved as the `demog` item, we can add additional complexity as needed. This may include things like setting equilibrium vital dynamics so birth and mortality rates are equal, producing a relatively stable population size, or an age distribution for our population. In this example, we pull the [age distribution](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/emod-api/blob/master/emod_api/demographics/PreDefinedDistributions.py) of all of Sub-Saharan Africa from the `emod-api` and then apply it to our demographics item. You may also add complexity through individual properties and other specific parameters as desired.

```{python, eval=F}
import emodpy_malaria.demographics.MalariaDemographics as Demographics
import emod_api.demographics.PreDefinedDistributions as Distributions

def build_demog():
    """
    This function builds a demographics input file for the DTK using emod_api.
    """

    demog = Demographics.from_template_node(lat=1.00, lon=1.00, pop=1000, name="Example_Site_Name", forced_id=1, init_prev=0.1)
    
    # Add equal birth and mortality rates
    demog.SetEquilibriumVitalDynamics()
    
    # Call and add age distribution
    age_distribution = Distributions.AgeDistribution_SSAfrica
    demog.SetAgeDistribution(age_distribution)

    return demog
```

## Generate demographics for multiple nodes

To run simultaneous simulations in multiple nodes, create an input file "my_nodes.csv" with one row for each node.

Ex. "my_nodes.csv"

| nodeid | lat   | lon   | population |
|--------|-------|-------|------------|
| 1      | 12.11 | -1.47 | 1000       |
| 2      | 12.03 | -1.44 | 1000       |
| 3      | 12.13 | -1.59 | 1000       |
| 17     | 12.06 | -1.48 | 1000       |

**Note**:  
-   Node IDs must be positive whole numbers, but do not have to be sequential  
-   lat/lon values should represent real places with climates suitable for malaria transmission (if weather files are generated from demographics)

Then, you can generate demographics `from_csv`](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emodpy-malaria/en/latest/emodpy_malaria.demographics.MalariaDemographics.html#emodpy_malaria.demographics.MalariaDemographics.from_csv) for each node in every simulation, by adding this code to `build_demog()`

```{python,eval=F}
def build_demog():
    """
    This function builds a demographics input file for the DTK using emod_api.
    """
    
    # From template node #
    ######################
    # This snippet allows you to manually specify the node details instead of using a .csv
    # demog = Demographics.from_template_node(lat=1, lon=2, pop=1000, name="Example_Site")
    # From input file csv #
    #######################
    demog = Demographics.from_csv(input_file = os.path.join(<path_to_file>,"my_nodes.csv"),
                                  id_ref='spatial_example', 
                                  init_prev = 0.01, 
                                  include_biting_heterogeneity = True)
    
    demog.SetEquilibriumVitalDynamics()
    age_distribution = Distributions.AgeDistribution_SSAfrica
    demog.SetAgeDistribution(age_distribution)
    return demog
```
## Add Migration between Nodes

Assuming, the same multi-node setup described above - we can add migration of humans and/or vectors between nodes.

1. Create migration.csv describing the rate of migration between nodes

| *To* | *From* | *Rate* | 
|----|------|------|
|   1|     2|   0.5|
|   2|     1|   0.5|
|   3|    17|  0.33|
|  17|     3|  0.33|

2. Run `generate_migration.py` to  convert the csv to binary file

3.
